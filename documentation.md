### **Security Considerations**

* **Password Storage:** Passwords must be encrypted using a strong hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).
* **Authorization & Access Control:** Ensure that each module (Admin, User, Mechanic) has restricted access to specific tables and actions.
* **Input Validation:** Proper validation should be in place to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
